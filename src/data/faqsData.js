        question: "What is the SNB App?",
        answer: "A smart neckband is a wearable device crafted to track real-time animal activity, health, and fertility. Worn around the neck of the animal, this wireless and GSM-based device is embedded with multiple sensors dedicated to monitoring health. Information gathered by the smart neckband is sent to the cloud before being relayed to the farmer's smartphone or computer, facilitating immediate monitoring and tracking of the animal's reproductive health. The device uses advanced technologies such as AI/ML algorithms to analyse the data and provide valuable insights into the animal's fertility status.",
